        "summary": "Single crystals of the systems Pr0.5(Ca1-xSrx)0.5MnO3,\n(Pr1-yYy)0.5(Ca1-xSrx)0.5MnO3, and Sm0.5Sr0.5MnO3 were grown to provide a\nseries of samples with fixed ratio Mn(III)/Mn(IV)=1 having geometric tolerance\nfactors that span the transition from localized to itinerant electronic\nbehavior of the MnO3 array. A unique ferromagnetic phase appears at the\ncritical tolerance factor tc= 0.975 that separates charge ordering and\nlocalized-electron behavior for t<tc from itinerant or molecular-orbital\nbehavior for t>tc. This ferromagnetic phase, which has to be distinguished from\nthe ferromagnetic metallic phase stabilized at tolerance factors t>tc,\nseparates two distinguishable Type-CE antiferromagnetic phases that are\nmetamagnetic. Measurements of the transport properties under hydrostatic\npressure were carried out on a compositions t a little below tc in order to\ncompare the effects of chemical vs. hydrostatic pressure on the phases that\ncompete with one another near t=tc."

        "summary": "The magnetic susceptibility of underdoped yttrium and lanthanum cuprates is\ninterpreted based on the self-consistent solution of the t-J model of a Cu-O\nplane. The calculations reproduce correctly the frequency dependencies of the\nsusceptibility in YBa2Cu3O_{7-y} and La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO4 attributing their\ndissimilarity to the difference in the damping of spin excitations. In\nYBa2Cu3O_{7-y} these excitations are well defined at the antiferromagnetic wave\nvector Q=(\\pi,\\pi) even in the normal state which manifests itself in a\npronounced maximum -- the resonance peak -- in the susceptibility. In\nLa_{2-x}Sr_xCuO4 the spin excitations are overdamped which leads to a broad\nlow-frequency feature in the susceptibility. The low-frequency\nincommensurability in the magnetic response is attributed to a dip in the\nmagnon damping at Q. The calculated concentration and temperature dependencies\nof the incommensurability parameter conform with experimental observations.\nGenerally the incommensurate magnetic response is not accompanied with an\ninhomogeneity of the carrier density."

Nanodomain boundaries are\nassumed to be the high diffusivity paths for oxygen transport whereas diffusion\ninto the domains proceeds much slower. Using Laplace transform methods, an\nexact solution is found for a ramped stepwise potential, allowing fitting of\nthe experimental data to theoretical curves (in Laplace transforms).\n  A further model generalization is considered by introducing additional\nparameters for the size distribution of domains and particles.\n  The model has been applied for qualitative evaluation of oxygen diffusion\nparameters from the data on wet electrochemical oxidation of nano-structured\nperovskite SrCo_0.5Fe_0.2Ta_0.3O_{3-y} samples."

We find that\nmany fluoro-perovskites have a ferroelectric instability in their high symmetry\ncubic structure, which is of similar amplitude to that commonly found in oxide\nperovskites. In contrast to the oxides, however, the fluorides have nominal\nBorn effective charges, indicating a different mechanism for the instability.\nWe show that the instability originates from ionic size effects, and is\ntherefore in most cases largely insensitive to pressure and strain, again in\ncontrast to the oxide perovskites. An exception is NaMnF3, where coherent\nepitaxial strain matching to a substrate with equal in-plane lattice constants\ndestabilizes the bulk Pnma structure leading to a ferroelectric, and indeed\nmultiferroic, ground state with an unusual polarization/strain response."

        "summary": "Recently, the perovskite BiCoO$_3$ has been shown experimentally to be\nisostructural with PbTiO$_3$, while simultaneously the $d^6$ Co$^{3+}$ ion has\na high spin ground state with $C$-type antiferromagnetic ordering. Using hybrid\ndensity functional calculations, we investigate the atomic, electronic and\nmagnetic structure of BiCoO$_3$ to elucidate the origin of the multiferroic\nstate. To begin with, we perform a qualitative trend sudy of the role of $d$\nelectrons in affecting the tendency for perovskite materials to exhibit a\nferroelectric distortion; this work initially explores a qualitative trend\nstudy in artificial cubic and tetragonal LaBO$_3$ perovskites. We choose La as\nthe A-cation so as to remove the effects of Bi $6s$ hybridization. Through\nfirst-principles calculations of the LaBO$_3$ series, where B is a $d^0 - d^8$\ncation from the $3d$-block, the trend study reveals that increasing the $d$\norbital occupation initially removes the tendency for a polar distortion, as\nexpected. However, for high spin $d^5-d^7$ and $d^8$ cations a strong\nferroelectric instability is recovered. We explained this effect in terms of\nthe pseudo Jahn-Teller theory for ferroelectricity. It is shown that, in some\ncases, unpaired electron spins actually drive ferroelectricity, rather than\ninhibit it, which represents a shift in the understanding of how\nferroelectricity and magnetism interact in perovskite oxides. It follows, that\nfor the case of BiCoO$_3$, the Co$^{3+}$ ion plays a major role in the\nferroelectric lattice instability. Importantly, the ferroelectric polarization\nis greatly enhanced when the Co$^{3+}$ ion is in the high spin state, when\ncompared to the nonmagnetic, low spin state, and a large coupling of the\nelectrical and magnetic polarization is present. Importantly, it is\ndemonstrated that the ground spin state is switched by reducing the internal\nferroelectric polarization."

For realistic interaction parameters we find several distinct\nsolutions exhibiting spin-triplet exciton condensate, which gives rise to a\nlocal spin density distribution while the ordered moments are vanishingly\nsmall. Rhombohedral distortion from the ideal cubic structure suppresses the\nordered state, contrary to the spin-orbit coupling which enhances the excitonic\ncondensation energy. We explain the trends observed in the numerical\nsimulations with the help of a simplified strong-coupling model. Our results\nindicate that LaCoO$_3$ is close to the excitonic instability and suggest ways\nto make it order."

This results in dimers, trimers, tetramers, or\nlonger fragments of chains of face-sharing octahedra in the crystal structures,\nand consequently in much shorter metal-metal distances and lower\nmetal-oxygen-metal bond angles than are seen in the more familiar perovskites.\nThe presence of the face-sharing octahedra can have a dramatic impact on\nmagnetic properties of these compounds, and dimer-based materials, in\nparticular, have been the subjects of many quantum-materials-directed studies\nin materials physics. Hexagonal oxide perovskites are of contemporary interest\ndue to their potential for geometrical frustration of the ordering of magnetic\nmoments or orbital occupancies at low temperatures, which is especially\nrelevant to their significance as quantum materials. As such, several hexagonal\noxide perovskites have been identified as potential candidates for hosting the\nquantum spin liquid state at low temperatures.

By supplementing this principle with\ninferential statistics and internet data mining we establish that currently\nknown perovskites are only the tip of the iceberg, and we enumerate ninety\nthousand hitherto-unknown compounds awaiting to be studied.

Current realizations of photonic\ncavities with topological boundaries are often limited by outcoupling issues or\npoor directionality and require complex design and fabrication that hinder\noperation at small wavelengths. Here we propose a topological cavity design\nbased on interface states between two one-dimensional photonic crystals with\ndistinct Zak phases and demonstrate a lithography-free, single-mode perovskite\nlaser emitting in the green. Few monolayers of solution processed all-inorganic\ncesium lead halide perovskite quantum dots are used as ultrathin gain medium.\nThe topological laser has planar design with large output aperture, akin to\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and is robust against\nvariations of the thickness of the gain medium, from deeply subwavelength to\nthick quantum dot films. This experimental observation also unveils the\ntopological nature of VCSELs, that is usually overlooked in the description of\nconventional Fabry-Perot cavity lasers. The design simplicity and topological\ncharacteristics make this perovskite quantum dot laser architecture suitable\nfor low-cost and fabrication tolerant vertical emitting lasers operating across\nthe visible spectral region."

As a proof of principle demonstration, we fabricate a\nsubwavelength-thin perovskite metasurface supporting bound states in the\ncontinuum (BICs). Upon the perovskite structural phase transitions, both its\nrefractive index and gain vary substantially, inducing fast (1.35 nm/K rate)\nand broad spectral tunability (>15 nm in the near-infrared), deterministic\nspatial mode hopping between polarization vortexes, and hysteretic optical\nbistability of the microlaser.

Thus, we theoretically derive an expression of\nthermopower in one-dimensional octahedral-MX6-clusters chain using\nlinear-response theory and electronic structure calculation of the chain based\non the tight-binding approximation. The derived expression of the thermopower\nis consistent with the extended Heikes formula and well reproduced experimental\ndata of several perovskite oxides at high temperatures.

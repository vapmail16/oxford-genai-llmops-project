        "summary": "We demonstrate four and two-terminal perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells\nwith ideally matched bandgaps. We develop an infrared absorbing 1.2eV bandgap\nperovskite, $FA_{0.75}Cs_{0.25}Sn_{0.5}Pb_{0.5}I_3$, that can deliver 14.8 %\nefficiency. By combining this material with a wider bandgap\n$FA_{0.83}Cs_{0.17}Pb(I_{0.5}Br_{0.5})_3$ material, we reach monolithic two\nterminal tandem efficiencies of 17.0 % with over 1.65 volts open-circuit\nvoltage. We also make mechanically stacked four terminal tandem cells and\nobtain 20.3 % efficiency. Crucially, we find that our infrared absorbing\nperovskite cells exhibit excellent thermal and atmospheric stability,\nunprecedented for Sn based perovskites. This device architecture and materials\nset will enable 'all perovskite' thin film solar cells to reach the highest\nefficiencies in the long term at the lowest costs."

        "summary": "A central characteristic of living beings is the ability to learn from and\nrespond to their environment leading to habit formation and decision making1-3.\nThis behavior, known as habituation, is universal among forms of life with a\ncentral nervous system, and interestingly observed even in single cellular\norganisms that do not possess a brain4-5. Here, we report the discovery of\nhabituation based plasticity utilizing a perovskite quantum system by dynamical\nmodulation of electron localization via reversible dopant incorporation.\nMicroscopic mechanisms and pathways that enable this organismic collective\ncharge-lattice interaction are elucidated by a combination of first-principles\ntheory, synchrotron investigations, ab-initio dynamical simulations and in-situ\nenvironmental breathing studies. We implement a new learning algorithm inspired\nfrom the conductance relaxation behavior of perovskites that naturally\nincorporates habituation and demonstrate \"learning to forget\": a key feature of\nanimal and human brains6. Most surprisingly, our results show that\nincorporating this elementary skill in learning dramatically boosts the\ncapability of artificial cognitive systems."

Recent studies of their\noptical properties suggest many novel opportunities for a design of advanced\nnanophotonic devices due to low-cost fabrication, high values of the refractive\nindex, existence of excitons at room temperatures, broadband bandgap\ntunability, high optical gain and nonlinear response, as well as simplicity of\ntheir integration with other types of structures.

        "summary": "A special class of anisotropic media, hyperbolic metamaterials and\nmetasurfaces (HMMs), has attracted much attention in recent years due to its\nunique abilities to manipulate and engineer electromagnetic waves on the\nsubwavelength scale. Because all HMM designs require metal dielectric\ncomposites, the unavoidable metal loss at optical frequencies inspired the\ndevelopment of active HMMs, where gain materials is incorporated to compensate\nthe metal loss. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an active type II HMM that\noperates at vacuum wavelength near 750 nm on a silicon platform. Different from\nprevious active HMMs operating below 1 {\\mu}m, the dielectric constituent in\nour HMM is solely composed of gain medium, by utilizing solution processed and\nwidely tunable metal halide perovskite gain. Thanks to the facile fabrication,\ntunability and silicon compatibility of our active HMM, this work paves the way\ntowards HMM's integration into on chip components, and eventually, into\nphotonic integrated circuits."

However, the costly single-crystalline substrates, e.g.\nSrTiO$_3$, were generally discarded after obtaining the freestanding thin\nfilms. Here, we demonstrate that the SrTiO$_3$ substrates can be recycled to\nfabricate La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ films with nearly identical structural\nand electrical properties. After attaining freestanding thin films, the\nresidues on SrTiO$_3$ can be removed by 80 \\degree C hot water soaking and\nrinsing treatments. Consequently, the surface of SrTiO$_3$ reverted to its\noriginal step-and-terrace structure."

These require\nflexible/wearable systems adaptable to body motions, thus materials conformable\nto non-planar surfaces, and able to maintain performance under mechanical\ndistortions. Here, we prepare fibre PDs combining rolled graphene layers and\nphotoactive perovskites. Conductive fibres ($\\sim$500$\\Omega$/cm) are made by\nrolling single layer graphene (SLG) around silica fibres, followed by\ndeposition of a dielectric layer (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and parylene C), another\nrolled SLG as channel, and perovskite as photoactive component. The resulting\ngate-tunable PDs have response time$\\sim$5ms, with an external\nresponsivity$\\sim$22kA/W at 488nm for 1V bias. The external responsivity is two\norders of magnitude higher and the response time one order of magnitude faster\nthan state-of-the-art wearable fibre based PDs. Under bending at 4mm radius, up\nto$\\sim$80\\% photocurrent is maintained. Washability tests show$\\sim$72\\% of\ninitial photocurrent after 30 cycles, promising for wearable applications."

In the market, a majority of the solar\npanels are made from silicon wafers. These solar panels have an efficiency of\n26.4 percent and can last more than 25 years. The perovskite solar cell is a\nrelatively new type of solar technology that has a similar maximum efficiency\nand much cheaper costs, the only downside is that it is less stable and the\nmost efficient type uses lead. The name perovskite refers to the crystal\nstructure with an ABX3 formula of the perovskite layer of the cell. All\nmaterials possess a property called a band gap. The smaller the band gap the\nmore conductive the material, but this does not necessarily mean that the\nsmaller the band gap the better the solar cell. The Shockley-Queisser limit\nprovides the optimal band gap in terms of efficiency for a single junction\nsolar cell which is 1.34 eV for single junction cells. This research focuses on\ntuning the band gap of lead-free perovskites through B-site cation replacement.\nThrough this investigation, the optical band gaps of tin and lead perovskites\nwere re-established. However, the copper-based perovskite disagrees with\nexisting DFT calculations. Additionally, the mixed tin and copper perovskite in\nthis experiment contradicts the intuitive prediction."

First-harmonic signal ({\\epsilon}2') of magnetically co-doped\nPGMN manifests finite polarization P(H) below 270K, corroborated by the\nmeasured remnant P-E traces. Second-harmonic ({\\epsilon}3') reveals the effect\nof random E-fields causing electrical vitreousity, latter indicated by the\ndivergent timescale of the fundamental response. LCCO features mixed-dipoles\nphase over appreciable temperature window, affiliated to the coexistent\nlow-spins (LS) and intermediate-spins (IS). Across the 65K-start of IS-to-LS\nstate transition (SST), dc- and ac-conductivities of LCCO exhibit\nmechanism-changeovers whereas the harmonic susceptibilities evidence\nIS/LS-interfacial hyper-polarizations. Below the 30K-end of SST, harmonics\ncorroborate the vitreous phase of dipoles in the LS-matrix state. In the LNMO,\npositive and negative (dual) magneto-dielectricity observed is respectively\nattributed to the charge-hopping between Ni2+ and Mn4+ ions and the interfacial\npolarization. Second-harmonic signal here also features dispersion\ncorresponding to the activation energy required for the electron transfer\nbetween Ni- and Mn-cations. Results from three different perovskite systems\nsignify the combined importance of first- and second-harmonics, for a detailed\nunderstanding of electrical configurations."

The calculations reproduce correctly the frequency dependencies of the\nsusceptibility in YBa2Cu3O_{7-y} and La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO4 attributing their\ndissimilarity to the difference in the damping of spin excitations. In\nYBa2Cu3O_{7-y} these excitations are well defined at the antiferromagnetic wave\nvector Q=(\\pi,\\pi) even in the normal state which manifests itself in a\npronounced maximum -- the resonance peak -- in the susceptibility. In\nLa_{2-x}Sr_xCuO4 the spin excitations are overdamped which leads to a broad\nlow-frequency feature in the susceptibility. The low-frequency\nincommensurability in the magnetic response is attributed to a dip in the\nmagnon damping at Q. The calculated concentration and temperature dependencies\nof the incommensurability parameter conform with experimental observations.\nGenerally the incommensurate magnetic response is not accompanied with an\ninhomogeneity of the carrier density."

In contrast to the oxides, however, the fluorides have nominal\nBorn effective charges, indicating a different mechanism for the instability.\nWe show that the instability originates from ionic size effects, and is\ntherefore in most cases largely insensitive to pressure and strain, again in\ncontrast to the oxide perovskites. An exception is NaMnF3, where coherent\nepitaxial strain matching to a substrate with equal in-plane lattice constants\ndestabilizes the bulk Pnma structure leading to a ferroelectric, and indeed\nmultiferroic, ground state with an unusual polarization/strain response."

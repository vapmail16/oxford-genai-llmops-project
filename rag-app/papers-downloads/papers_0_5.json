[{"title": "Altermagnetic Perovskites", "summary": "Altermagnet is a class of antiferromagnets, which shows a staggered spin\nordering with wave vector ${\\bm q}=0$, while its net magnetization is canceled\nout in the limit of zero relativistic spin-orbit coupling. The simplest case is\nwhen the up and down spins are ordered on two crystallographically equivalent\nsublattice sites within the unit cell that are not connected by translation,\nand consequently, the system breaks the macroscopic time-reversal symmetry.\nAccordingly, it exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting in the energy band and\ncharacteristic cross-correlation phenomena between spin, charge, and lattice\n(orbital) degrees of freedom. This is in contrast to conventional N\\'{e}el-type\nantiferromagnets with ${\\bm q} \\neq 0$ conserving the macroscopic time-reversal\nsymmetry, where the time-reversal operation flipping of spins combined with\ntranslation can make the system identical to the original state.\nAltermagneticsm is universally latent in various magnetic materials that have\nbeen considered as simple collinear-type antiferromagnets. In this article, we\nfocus on perovskites with chemical formula {\\it ABX}$_3$, which are typical\nplaygrounds for strongly correlated electron systems, and overview their\naltermagnetic aspects that have been overlooked in the past researches, based\non microscopic model studies revealing the mechanisms of their properties. We\ndisplay that a combination of a variety of antiferromagnetic ordering and the\ncommonly-seen lattice distortions in perovskites gives rise to a\nnon-relativistic spin splitting whose mechanism does not rely on the spin-orbit\ncoupling and its consequent spin current generation, and the anomalous Hall\neffect in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling."}, {"title": "Perovskite-perovskite tandem photovoltaics with optimized bandgaps", "summary": "We demonstrate four and two-terminal perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells\nwith ideally matched bandgaps.

Here, we report the discovery of\nhabituation based plasticity utilizing a perovskite quantum system by dynamical\nmodulation of electron localization via reversible dopant incorporation.\nMicroscopic mechanisms and pathways that enable this organismic collective\ncharge-lattice interaction are elucidated by a combination of first-principles\ntheory, synchrotron investigations, ab-initio dynamical simulations and in-situ\nenvironmental breathing studies. We implement a new learning algorithm inspired\nfrom the conductance relaxation behavior of perovskites that naturally\nincorporates habituation and demonstrate \"learning to forget\": a key feature of\nanimal and human brains6.

Because all HMM designs require metal dielectric\ncomposites, the unavoidable metal loss at optical frequencies inspired the\ndevelopment of active HMMs, where gain materials is incorporated to compensate\nthe metal loss. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an active type II HMM that\noperates at vacuum wavelength near 750 nm on a silicon platform. Different from\nprevious active HMMs operating below 1 {\\mu}m, the dielectric constituent in\nour HMM is solely composed of gain medium, by utilizing solution processed and\nwidely tunable metal halide perovskite gain.

In the market, a majority of the solar\npanels are made from silicon wafers. These solar panels have an efficiency of\n26.4 percent and can last more than 25 years. The perovskite solar cell is a\nrelatively new type of solar technology that has a similar maximum efficiency\nand much cheaper costs, the only downside is that it is less stable and the\nmost efficient type uses lead. The name perovskite refers to the crystal\nstructure with an ABX3 formula of the perovskite layer of the cell. All\nmaterials possess a property called a band gap. The smaller the band gap the\nmore conductive the material, but this does not necessarily mean that the\nsmaller the band gap the better the solar cell. The Shockley-Queisser limit\nprovides the optimal band gap in terms of efficiency for a single junction\nsolar cell which is 1.34 eV for single junction cells. This research focuses on\ntuning the band gap of lead-free perovskites through B-site cation replacement.\nThrough this investigation, the optical band gaps of tin and lead perovskites\nwere re-established.

In\nYBa2Cu3O_{7-y} these excitations are well defined at the antiferromagnetic wave\nvector Q=(\\pi,\\pi) even in the normal state which manifests itself in a\npronounced maximum -- the resonance peak -- in the susceptibility. In\nLa_{2-x}Sr_xCuO4 the spin excitations are overdamped which leads to a broad\nlow-frequency feature in the susceptibility. The low-frequency\nincommensurability in the magnetic response is attributed to a dip in the\nmagnon damping at Q.

Using hybrid\ndensity functional calculations, we investigate the atomic, electronic and\nmagnetic structure of BiCoO$_3$ to elucidate the origin of the multiferroic\nstate. To begin with, we perform a qualitative trend sudy of the role of $d$\nelectrons in affecting the tendency for perovskite materials to exhibit a\nferroelectric distortion; this work initially explores a qualitative trend\nstudy in artificial cubic and tetragonal LaBO$_3$ perovskites. We choose La as\nthe A-cation so as to remove the effects of Bi $6s$ hybridization. Through\nfirst-principles calculations of the LaBO$_3$ series, where B is a $d^0 - d^8$\ncation from the $3d$-block, the trend study reveals that increasing the $d$\norbital occupation initially removes the tendency for a polar distortion, as\nexpected. However, for high spin $d^5-d^7$ and $d^8$ cations a strong\nferroelectric instability is recovered. We explained this effect in terms of\nthe pseudo Jahn-Teller theory for ferroelectricity. It is shown that, in some\ncases, unpaired electron spins actually drive ferroelectricity, rather than\ninhibit it, which represents a shift in the understanding of how\nferroelectricity and magnetism interact in perovskite oxides.

Importantly, the ferroelectric polarization\nis greatly enhanced when the Co$^{3+}$ ion is in the high spin state, when\ncompared to the nonmagnetic, low spin state, and a large coupling of the\nelectrical and magnetic polarization is present.

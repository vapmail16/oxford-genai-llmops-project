[{"title": "Active Perovskite Hyperbolic Metasurface", "summary": "A special class of anisotropic media, hyperbolic metamaterials and\nmetasurfaces (HMMs), has attracted much attention in recent years due to its\nunique abilities to manipulate and engineer electromagnetic waves on the\nsubwavelength scale. Because all HMM designs require metal dielectric\ncomposites, the unavoidable metal loss at optical frequencies inspired the\ndevelopment of active HMMs, where gain materials is incorporated to compensate\nthe metal loss. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an active type II HMM that\noperates at vacuum wavelength near 750 nm on a silicon platform. Different from\nprevious active HMMs operating below 1 {\\mu}m, the dielectric constituent in\nour HMM is solely composed of gain medium, by utilizing solution processed and\nwidely tunable metal halide perovskite gain. Thanks to the facile fabrication,\ntunability and silicon compatibility of our active HMM, this work paves the way\ntowards HMM's integration into on chip components, and eventually, into\nphotonic integrated circuits."}, {"title": "Recycling of Perovskite Substrate", "summary": "The use of water-soluble sacrificial layer of Sr$_3$Al$_2$O$_6$ has\ntremendously boosted the research on freestanding functional oxide thin films,\nespecially thanks to its ultimate capability to produce high-quality epitaxial\nperovskite thin films.

Here, we prepare fibre PDs combining rolled graphene layers and\nphotoactive perovskites. Conductive fibres ($\\sim$500$\\Omega$/cm) are made by\nrolling single layer graphene (SLG) around silica fibres, followed by\ndeposition of a dielectric layer (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and parylene C), another\nrolled SLG as channel, and perovskite as photoactive component. The resulting\ngate-tunable PDs have response time$\\sim$5ms, with an external\nresponsivity$\\sim$22kA/W at 488nm for 1V bias. The external responsivity is two\norders of magnitude higher and the response time one order of magnitude faster\nthan state-of-the-art wearable fibre based PDs.

In the market, a majority of the solar\npanels are made from silicon wafers. These solar panels have an efficiency of\n26.4 percent and can last more than 25 years. The perovskite solar cell is a\nrelatively new type of solar technology that has a similar maximum efficiency\nand much cheaper costs, the only downside is that it is less stable and the\nmost efficient type uses lead. The name perovskite refers to the crystal\nstructure with an ABX3 formula of the perovskite layer of the cell. All\nmaterials possess a property called a band gap. The smaller the band gap the\nmore conductive the material, but this does not necessarily mean that the\nsmaller the band gap the better the solar cell. The Shockley-Queisser limit\nprovides the optimal band gap in terms of efficiency for a single junction\nsolar cell which is 1.34 eV for single junction cells. This research focuses on\ntuning the band gap of lead-free perovskites through B-site cation replacement.\nThrough this investigation, the optical band gaps of tin and lead perovskites\nwere re-established.

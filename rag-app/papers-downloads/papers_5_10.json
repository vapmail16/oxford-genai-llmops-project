        "summary": "The use of water-soluble sacrificial layer of Sr$_3$Al$_2$O$_6$ has\ntremendously boosted the research on freestanding functional oxide thin films,\nespecially thanks to its ultimate capability to produce high-quality epitaxial\nperovskite thin films. However, the costly single-crystalline substrates, e.g.\nSrTiO$_3$, were generally discarded after obtaining the freestanding thin\nfilms. Here, we demonstrate that the SrTiO$_3$ substrates can be recycled to\nfabricate La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ films with nearly identical structural\nand electrical properties. After attaining freestanding thin films, the\nresidues on SrTiO$_3$ can be removed by 80 \\degree C hot water soaking and\nrinsing treatments. Consequently, the surface of SrTiO$_3$ reverted to its\noriginal step-and-terrace structure."

        "summary": "The integration of optoelectronic devices, such as transistors and\nphotodetectors (PDs), into wearables and textiles is of great interest for\napplications such as healthcare and physiological monitoring. These require\nflexible/wearable systems adaptable to body motions, thus materials conformable\nto non-planar surfaces, and able to maintain performance under mechanical\ndistortions. Here, we prepare fibre PDs combining rolled graphene layers and\nphotoactive perovskites. Conductive fibres ($\\sim$500$\\Omega$/cm) are made by\nrolling single layer graphene (SLG) around silica fibres, followed by\ndeposition of a dielectric layer (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and parylene C), another\nrolled SLG as channel, and perovskite as photoactive component. The resulting\ngate-tunable PDs have response time$\\sim$5ms, with an external\nresponsivity$\\sim$22kA/W at 488nm for 1V bias. The external responsivity is two\norders of magnitude higher and the response time one order of magnitude faster\nthan state-of-the-art wearable fibre based PDs. Under bending at 4mm radius, up\nto$\\sim$80\\% photocurrent is maintained. Washability tests show$\\sim$72\\% of\ninitial photocurrent after 30 cycles, promising for wearable applications."

        "summary": "One of the most viable renewable energies is solar power because of its\nversatility, reliability, and abundance. In the market, a majority of the solar\npanels are made from silicon wafers. These solar panels have an efficiency of\n26.4 percent and can last more than 25 years. The perovskite solar cell is a\nrelatively new type of solar technology that has a similar maximum efficiency\nand much cheaper costs, the only downside is that it is less stable and the\nmost efficient type uses lead. The name perovskite refers to the crystal\nstructure with an ABX3 formula of the perovskite layer of the cell. All\nmaterials possess a property called a band gap. The smaller the band gap the\nmore conductive the material, but this does not necessarily mean that the\nsmaller the band gap the better the solar cell. The Shockley-Queisser limit\nprovides the optimal band gap in terms of efficiency for a single junction\nsolar cell which is 1.34 eV for single junction cells. This research focuses on\ntuning the band gap of lead-free perovskites through B-site cation replacement.\nThrough this investigation, the optical band gaps of tin and lead perovskites\nwere re-established. However, the copper-based perovskite disagrees with\nexisting DFT calculations. Additionally, the mixed tin and copper perovskite in\nthis experiment contradicts the intuitive prediction."

Second-harmonic ({\\epsilon}3') reveals the effect\nof random E-fields causing electrical vitreousity, latter indicated by the\ndivergent timescale of the fundamental response. LCCO features mixed-dipoles\nphase over appreciable temperature window, affiliated to the coexistent\nlow-spins (LS) and intermediate-spins (IS). Across the 65K-start of IS-to-LS\nstate transition (SST), dc- and ac-conductivities of LCCO exhibit\nmechanism-changeovers whereas the harmonic susceptibilities evidence\nIS/LS-interfacial hyper-polarizations. Below the 30K-end of SST, harmonics\ncorroborate the vitreous phase of dipoles in the LS-matrix state. In the LNMO,\npositive and negative (dual) magneto-dielectricity observed is respectively\nattributed to the charge-hopping between Ni2+ and Mn4+ ions and the interfacial\npolarization. Second-harmonic signal here also features dispersion\ncorresponding to the activation energy required for the electron transfer\nbetween Ni- and Mn-cations.

The calculations reproduce correctly the frequency dependencies of the\nsusceptibility in YBa2Cu3O_{7-y} and La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO4 attributing their\ndissimilarity to the difference in the damping of spin excitations. In\nYBa2Cu3O_{7-y} these excitations are well defined at the antiferromagnetic wave\nvector Q=(\\pi,\\pi) even in the normal state which manifests itself in a\npronounced maximum -- the resonance peak -- in the susceptibility. In\nLa_{2-x}Sr_xCuO4 the spin excitations are overdamped which leads to a broad\nlow-frequency feature in the susceptibility. The low-frequency\nincommensurability in the magnetic response is attributed to a dip in the\nmagnon damping at Q. The calculated concentration and temperature dependencies\nof the incommensurability parameter conform with experimental observations.\nGenerally the incommensurate magnetic response is not accompanied with an\ninhomogeneity of the carrier density."

We find that\nmany fluoro-perovskites have a ferroelectric instability in their high symmetry\ncubic structure, which is of similar amplitude to that commonly found in oxide\nperovskites. In contrast to the oxides, however, the fluorides have nominal\nBorn effective charges, indicating a different mechanism for the instability.\nWe show that the instability originates from ionic size effects, and is\ntherefore in most cases largely insensitive to pressure and strain, again in\ncontrast to the oxide perovskites. An exception is NaMnF3, where coherent\nepitaxial strain matching to a substrate with equal in-plane lattice constants\ndestabilizes the bulk Pnma structure leading to a ferroelectric, and indeed\nmultiferroic, ground state with an unusual polarization/strain response."

Using hybrid\ndensity functional calculations, we investigate the atomic, electronic and\nmagnetic structure of BiCoO$_3$ to elucidate the origin of the multiferroic\nstate. To begin with, we perform a qualitative trend sudy of the role of $d$\nelectrons in affecting the tendency for perovskite materials to exhibit a\nferroelectric distortion; this work initially explores a qualitative trend\nstudy in artificial cubic and tetragonal LaBO$_3$ perovskites. We choose La as\nthe A-cation so as to remove the effects of Bi $6s$ hybridization. Through\nfirst-principles calculations of the LaBO$_3$ series, where B is a $d^0 - d^8$\ncation from the $3d$-block, the trend study reveals that increasing the $d$\norbital occupation initially removes the tendency for a polar distortion, as\nexpected. However, for high spin $d^5-d^7$ and $d^8$ cations a strong\nferroelectric instability is recovered. We explained this effect in terms of\nthe pseudo Jahn-Teller theory for ferroelectricity. It is shown that, in some\ncases, unpaired electron spins actually drive ferroelectricity, rather than\ninhibit it, which represents a shift in the understanding of how\nferroelectricity and magnetism interact in perovskite oxides. It follows, that\nfor the case of BiCoO$_3$, the Co$^{3+}$ ion plays a major role in the\nferroelectric lattice instability. Importantly, the ferroelectric polarization\nis greatly enhanced when the Co$^{3+}$ ion is in the high spin state, when\ncompared to the nonmagnetic, low spin state, and a large coupling of the\nelectrical and magnetic polarization is present. Importantly, it is\ndemonstrated that the ground spin state is switched by reducing the internal\nferroelectric polarization."

Rhombohedral distortion from the ideal cubic structure suppresses the\nordered state, contrary to the spin-orbit coupling which enhances the excitonic\ncondensation energy.

This results in dimers, trimers, tetramers, or\nlonger fragments of chains of face-sharing octahedra in the crystal structures,\nand consequently in much shorter metal-metal distances and lower\nmetal-oxygen-metal bond angles than are seen in the more familiar perovskites.\nThe presence of the face-sharing octahedra can have a dramatic impact on\nmagnetic properties of these compounds, and dimer-based materials, in\nparticular, have been the subjects of many quantum-materials-directed studies\nin materials physics. Hexagonal oxide perovskites are of contemporary interest\ndue to their potential for geometrical frustration of the ordering of magnetic\nmoments or orbital occupancies at low temperatures, which is especially\nrelevant to their significance as quantum materials.
